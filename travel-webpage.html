        <p>The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[260] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[260] Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.[261]</p>
